#### Project_Landing-Page
# Introduction
The project is to make a website using 2 provided 
images, or you can try and make/design one your self.


The first picture is the full design showing what 
(if you try and follow along) you will try to accomplish.

The second image is a reference for colors and fonts used in the example.

I tried to follow the example because I have no experience with web development, 
and to make sure I understood the lessons by trying to get as close as I could.

# What I learned
As said in the introduction I tried to follow along with the examples given, 

I am clad I did because I really had to think outside the box and it really 
challenged my understating of the parent and child relationship of the Flexbox.

After remaking certain section again and again because I was not happy with how it turned out. 
I think I made something really close its still not perfect as it does not really work well on 
small screens but it is flexible and that was what I tried to build.
